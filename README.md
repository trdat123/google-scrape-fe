## Technology used

### Front-end

-   Front-end uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [React](https://react.dev/) + [Bun](https://bun.sh/): Vite for starting local server. Bun for installing dependencies. Both of them are blazingly fast.
-   UI library: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/examples/mail) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   Authentication: [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)

### Back-end

-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as JavaScript run time, managing dependencies, and testing
-   Scraping library: [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/). Puppeteer will run Chrome or Chromium based browser in headless mode (Like a normal user). Allow it to do automate task and scraping data in browser easily.
-   Database & ORM: [vercel/postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres) & [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
-   API layer: [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
